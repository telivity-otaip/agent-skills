description: Drives unattended code-improvement passes through a multi-gate pipeline — scan, isolate, execute, self-review, adversarial check, domain guard, PR. Use when running an autonomous loop that opens PRs without a human in the loop, when you need to bound LLM spend per task, or when the codebase has zones that require human domain expertise the agent must not fabricate.

# Autonomous Code Improvement

## Overview

Autonomous coding agents fail in three predictable ways: they guess when they hit domain-specific code, they have no cost controls, and they let the model that wrote the change confirm the change is good. This skill defines the discipline that prevents all three. Every change goes through a pipeline of orthogonal gates — none of which the executing model can override on its own.

A reference TypeScript implementation lives at [asil-monorepo](https://github.com/telivity-otaip/asil). This skill is the *process* — apply the gates regardless of language or framework.

## When to Use

- Running a recurring autonomous loop that opens PRs unattended (a "grind" pass)
- Building an agent that operates on a codebase without a synchronous human reviewer
- Wrapping any LLM-driven code generator that needs cost ceilings
- Operating on code that has domain-specific business rules an agent could plausibly fabricate
- Any agent design where you'd otherwise be tempted to skip review because the agent already "knows what it's doing"

**When NOT to use:**

- One-shot synchronous edits where a human is reading every diff before merge
- Pure refactoring tasks with strong existing test coverage and no new behavior
- Tasks fully covered by `incremental-implementation` and `test-driven-development` with a human at the keyboard

**Related:** This skill *composes* existing repo primitives rather than duplicating them. The three review gates in Step 6 dispatch to the existing `agents/code-reviewer.md`, `agents/security-auditor.md`, and `agents/test-engineer.md` personas — the same ones `/ship` fans out to. The worktree discipline in Step 3 follows `git-workflow-and-versioning`'s "Working with Worktrees" section. The novel parts of this skill are the *unattended-loop wrapper* around those primitives: domain-question gating, adversarial cross-family review, and per-task cost checkpoints.

```

Every node is an independent veto. Any gate can return the task to the queue or kill it outright.

### Step 1: SCAN — Find candidate work

Pick categories your codebase produces signal on:

- Test failures (failing tests are a clear contract)
- Type errors (the compiler already disagrees)
- TODO resolution (text the maintainer left behind)
- Dead code (export-graph reachability)
- Coverage gaps (untested branches in changed files)

Don't scan for "things that could be better" — that's an unbounded category and the loop will churn. Stick to categories where ground truth exists.

### Step 2: TRIAGE — Pause on domain questions

Sprinkle `// DOMAIN_QUESTION: <one-line question>` markers in code paths where business rules live. Before any task runs, the loop must check whether the diff would touch a marker that has no resolved answer. If yes — **stop**, present the question to a human, persist the answer, and only then proceed.

The point: the agent must not invent a domain answer to keep going.

### Step 3: ISOLATE — One disposable worktree per task

For the worktree mechanics, follow `skills/git-workflow-and-versioning` ("Working with Worktrees"). The autonomous-loop deltas on top of that baseline:

- **One worktree per task, disposable.** Created at task start, deleted whether the task succeeds or fails. The worktree is never reused across tasks.
- **Main checkout is read-only from the loop's perspective.** The loop never touches `<repo-root>` directly. If a task fails halfway, the worktree gets deleted and the task is requeued — not retried in place.
- **FUSE / Google Drive fallback.** On filesystems where `git worktree add` fails (some FUSE mounts, Google Drive's case-insensitive cloud filesystem), fall back to `git clone <repo> <task-dir>` plus a checkout of the task branch. The loop must detect the failure and switch automatically — manual intervention defeats the unattended model.

### Step 4: EXECUTE — LLM-generated patch, applied programmatically

Send a scoped prompt that includes: the relevant skill markdown, project rules (configurable), the failing signal, and the file contents. Have the LLM emit complete file contents in `<<<FILE: path>>> … <<<END FILE>>>` blocks (NOT a unified diff — the model misreads line numbers).

Compute the diff yourself (`diff -u`), validate with `git apply --check`, then apply.

### Step 5: TYPECHECK + TESTS — In the worktree, on the patched code

`pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` (or your equivalent). Failure here returns the task to the queue with a `tests-failing` reason. Do not have the same model "fix the test" — it'll rationalize. Either let a different model try (next pass) or escalate.

### Step 6: SELF-REVIEW — Three personas, diff only

Dispatch the diff to the three review personas already defined in this repo:

- `agents/code-reviewer.md` — the five-axis review (correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance)
- `agents/security-auditor.md` — vulnerability detection, threat modeling, secure-coding practices
- `agents/test-engineer.md` — test strategy, coverage, edge-case analysis

The fan-out structure is the same one `/ship` already implements — read its Phase A for the parallel-dispatch pattern. The autonomous-loop variant differs in three specific ways:

- **Diff-only scoping.** Each persona receives the diff and *only* the diff — no surrounding source, no prior conversation context, no commit history. `/ship` runs against staged changes in a working repo where the persona can read more for context; this loop runs in an isolated worktree against a single patch and refuses to widen the view. Cross-persona pollution is what makes self-review theater; bounded scope is what prevents it.
- **No human merge step.** `/ship` ends in a go/no-go decision a human acts on. This loop has no human in the immediate path — the personas' verdicts directly determine whether the task continues. That's why the return values are tightened to `pass | concerns | blocker` rather than narrative reports: blockers automatically terminate the task and roll back the worktree, concerns are logged on the eventual PR, only `pass` lets the task proceed to Step 7.
- **Hard pass/concerns/blocker contract.** Each persona's prompt must enforce the three-state output schema. Free-form review prose is ambiguous to a downstream automaton — the loop needs a machine-checkable verdict.

### Step 7: ADVERSARIAL GATE — Different LLM, different provider

Send the diff to a model from a *different family* (e.g., OpenAI when the writer was Anthropic, or vice versa) with the prompt: "Try to break this. Find a reason it should NOT merge." Different families fail differently — what one family rationalizes the other often catches.

### Step 8: DOMAIN GUARD — Final check

Re-scan the diff for `DOMAIN_QUESTION` markers in any file the diff touches. If any such marker exists with no resolved answer, block the PR and surface to a human. This is the redundancy layer — Step 2 already triaged at queue time, but new markers can appear during execution.

### Step 9: OPEN PR — Only if every gate passed

The PR description includes: the original signal, the personas' notes, the adversarial gate's result, and the cost spent on this task.

## Cost Discipline

Every LLM call passes through a checkpoint bound to `(taskId, systemId, agentId)`:

```
checkpoint.recordAndCheck(inputTokens, outputTokens, model)
```

The checkpoint refuses the call if the task budget, the daily cap, or the kill switch threshold is breached. Spend is persisted to disk per task — reports and audits work after the fact.

Use `decimal.js` (or your language's exact-decimal type) for every cost number. Float drift on currency is a real bug.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Three reviews is overkill — the writer's review is fine" | The writer's review IS theater. Different personas catch different classes of bug. The adversarial gate especially. |
| "We can just trust the LLM on the domain logic" | This is exactly how silent regressions ship. The DOMAIN_QUESTION marker is cheap insurance. |
| "I'll add cost controls later" | "Later" is after a $200 spike. Costs compound silently — the kill switch must exist on day one. |
| "Worktree isolation is too much ceremony" | Until a half-applied patch corrupts your main checkout. Disposable worktrees ARE the ceremony — they save you. |
| "The adversarial gate keeps rejecting things, let me lower its threshold" | The gate has a real point. Lower thresholds correlate with regressions. Fix the underlying signal. |
| "Skip the gates for trivial diffs" | "Trivial" diffs ship the most regressions because nobody read them carefully. |
| "I'll have the same model self-review faster" | Same model, same blind spots. Cross-family review is non-optional. |
| "We don't need worktree isolation, the loop won't touch other files" | Until the LLM emits a file path that escapes scope. Isolation is a guarantee, not a hope. |
| "If the file content shown is empty, a minimal replacement is safe" | Empty content in the prompt rarely means the file is empty on disk — it usually means the upstream fetch failed. A minimal replacement silently deletes real code. The executor must check on-disk state before applying, not just the prompt. |

## Red Flags

- Pipeline that has the same model write the code and review the code
- No cost ceiling — task can run as long as the LLM stays in context
- No DOMAIN_QUESTION mechanism (or equivalent) for unknown business rules
- Patches applied to main checkout, not a worktree
- Self-review runs on the entire codebase, not just the diff
- Adversarial gate uses the same model family as the writer
- "All gates pass" announced before any gate has actually run
- Task is retried in place after a failure instead of being rolled back to a clean worktree
- Diff format requires the LLM to compute line numbers (it will hallucinate them)
- Domain answers stored only in conversation context — must be persisted to survive across runs
- Executor accepts an empty-content prompt and produces a minimal-replacement diff without checking on-disk content (silent code deletion failure mode)
- Diff that net-deletes more than half of an existing file is accepted by gates outside the `dead-code` task category

## Verification

Before considering an autonomous loop production-ready:

- [ ] A failing scan category short-circuits the run with a clear reason
- [ ] At least one DOMAIN_QUESTION marker has been triaged end-to-end (question presented, answer persisted, dependent file unblocked)
- [ ] The adversarial gate has rejected at least one task in dogfooding — if it never rejects anything, it's not actually challenging the writer
- [ ] The kill switch has been tested by setting an artificially low budget and confirming the loop stops mid-task
- [ ] A worktree creation failure (e.g., simulated disk full) results in the task being marked failed and the loop continuing — no main-checkout corruption
- [ ] Cost reports correctly attribute spend to `(taskId, systemId, agentId)` triples — not a single bucket
- [ ] PRs opened by the loop have a body that includes: the original signal, the persona notes, the adversarial result, and the task cost
- [ ] Empty-content guard: executor refuses to apply a diff when the on-disk file has content but the prompt's file content is empty (catches upstream-fetch-failure scenarios)
- [ ] Destructive-diff guard: diffs that net-delete more than 50% of an existing file are rejected unless task category is `dead-code`

## Reference Implementation

A working TypeScript reference is available as a four-package monorepo: [asil-monorepo](https://github.com/telivity-otaip/asil). It implements every node of the pipeline described above:

- `asil-cost-controller` — token budget governor, checkpoints, kill switch
- `asil-thought-multiplier` — strategic thinking layer (router, thinkers, synthesizer, papa)
- `asil-improvement-loop` — the pipeline itself (scanner, executor, self-review, gates)
- `asil-runners` — Anthropic + OpenAI wirings, CLI entry points

Adopt the reference verbatim or extract the pieces you need. The interfaces (`LLMCaller`, `LoopDeps`) are deliberately tiny so providers and dependencies can be swapped.
